                    <h4>Beetlejuice</h4>
                    <p>Its showtime! Based on Tim Burtons dearly beloved film, this hilarious musical tells the 
                        story of Lydia Deetz, a strange and unusual teenager whose whole life changes when she 
                        meets a recently deceased couple and a demon with a thing for stripes. With an irreverent book, 
                        an astonishing set, and a score that is out of this Netherworld, BEETLEJUICE is “SCREAMINGLY GOOD FUN!” (Variety). 
                        And under its uproarious surface (six feet under, to be exact), it is a remarkably touching show about family, love,
                        and making the most of every Day-O!

                    <h4>Hamilton</h4>
                    <p>Hamilton is a Broadway musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of America's 
                        Founding Fathers. The play follows his rise from an orphaned immigrant to George Washington's right-hand man, his role 
                        in shaping the U.S. financial system, and his downfall due to personal and political conflicts. The story highlights his
                        rivalry with Aaron Burr, which ultimately leads to their fatal duel. The musical blends hip-hop, R&B, and traditional 
                        show tunes to modernize history and emphasize themes of ambition, legacy, and democracy.

                    <h4>Swan Lake</h4>
                    <p> Swan Lake is a classical ballet composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It tells the story of Prince Siegfried, who falls 
                        in love with Odette, a princess cursed to live as a swan by the evil sorcerer Rothbart. The spell can only be broken by 
                        true love. However, Rothbart tricks Siegfried into pledging his love to Odile, the sorcerer’s daughter, who resembles Odette.
                        Realizing his mistake, Siegfried rushes back to Odette, but their love cannot break the curse. The ballet’s ending varies, 
                        with some versions featuring a tragic conclusion where the lovers perish together, while others offer a more hopeful resolution.
